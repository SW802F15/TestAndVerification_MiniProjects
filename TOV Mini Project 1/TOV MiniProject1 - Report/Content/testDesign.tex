\section{Test Design}
The success of the entire product is determined based on the completion of the overall user story: \textit{Play music that fits with the user's running speed.}

For better estimation of completion, we have created multiple smaller user stories, which will serve as basis for the overall success.

All user stores should be given a priority, low or high, where low priority stories must be non-critical, i.e., the app still fulfills the primary user story if they fail. We accept that low priority user stories fail. All other tests must pass.\\

\noindent For a test to pass, it is essential that it at least is tested as perscribed:

\begin{itemize}
\item All user stories must be tested with unit tests, descriping its functionallity. (Flyt til intro som led i xp)
\item All actions (button press, etc.) Must be accomandated within X seconds.
\item The functionality of the user story must work, if activated as perscribed. (Test to pass)
\end{itemize}
