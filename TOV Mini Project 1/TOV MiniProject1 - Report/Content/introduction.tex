For the test mini project, we have decided to create acceptance tests.
We chose acceptance tests, since it would fit nicely with our semester project.
In our semester project we develop using the eXtreme Programming methodology.
Acceptance tests are an integral part of eXtreme Programming, hence it has it own approach.

In eXtreme Programming acceptance tests are constructed together with the customer, based on the user stories for each iteration.
In our semester project we are our own surrogate customer, meaning we will be in the role of the customer when creating the acceptance tests.

Although acceptance tests being a dynamic black box test, we need to write the code to make the acceptance tests automated.
We use the tool \texttt{Robotium} to write the code part of the test. 
This tool allows us to programmatically emulate the touch and controls of a user.
