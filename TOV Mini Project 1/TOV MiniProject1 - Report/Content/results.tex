\section{Results of Test Cases}
\subsection{Music Player}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|cc|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Test Title} & Test Status \\ \hline
Play .mp3 files.                                  & \textbf{\checkmark} \\\hline
Locate .mp3 files on device.                & \textbf{\checkmark}     \\\hline
Obtain beats-per-minute for song.       & \textbf{\checkmark}     \\\hline
Navigate songs.                                 & \textbf{\checkmark}      \\\hline
Keep playing when screen is off.          & \textbf{\checkmark}      \\\hline
Adjust music speed.                           & \textbf{$\times$}      \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textit{Adjust music speed} failed the test, as it was not implemented.


\subsection{Step Counter}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|cc|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Test Title} & Test Status \\ \hline
Detect the pace of the user.                 & \textbf{\checkmark} \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Non-graphical Interface}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|p{12cm}c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Test Title} & Test Status \\ \hline
As a user, I, would like to save power by turning off the screen while still being able to navigate songs when the screen is off.
A screen is turned off when the power button is pressed.                & \textbf{$\times$}     \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The test failed, as the Android devices, the application is developed for, lack support for detecting touch events. A workaround for this feature was implemented, where a black overlay is shown on the screen, so it appears to be turned off. If we test the workaround instead of turning the screen off, the test passes.
