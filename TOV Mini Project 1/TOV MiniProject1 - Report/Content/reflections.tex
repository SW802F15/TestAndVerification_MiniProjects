\section{Reflection}
\subsection{Test Cases}
Discuss our test cases, why they did not work, and what we have done to mitigate this.

What is the coverage of our acceptance tests.

What do we feel we benefited from using acceptance tests?

How good is our acceptance test - why not better?

Automatise acceptance test, what would it do, and what would it take to do it.

\paragraph{Prior Knowledge of the Code}
Since the acceptance tests were written after the code, we might have been biased. We suspect that this had the consequence of resulting in different tests, than if we did now know anything about the code. Because we had knowledge of the code one could say that we had white box knowledge of the code. We knew where its strengths and weaknesses were, so we naturally had a different insight which resulted in different acceptance tests.
This possibly had the consequence of us writing tests to pass the code, and not the other way around. If a customer had written the acceptance tests, they would possibly also had been different. Both because of the customer's lack of knowledge of the code, but also because the customer might have a different idea about which criteria the code should fulfill.


\subsection{Acceptance Test}
Discuss acceptance test as a practice, advantages and disadvantages.

How we see acceptance tests done correctly and why it is not more used.
