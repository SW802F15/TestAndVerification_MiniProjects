\section{Task 3}
\label{sec:task3}
\textit{Determine the feasibility limit depending on the number of boys, girls, thiefs.}\\\\
If we add 1 more of either boy, girl, or thief no schedule can be found. Because of the imposed restraints it is not possible to complete the task without either relaxing the restraints, adding more controllers (fathers, mothers, police officers), or buying a bigger boat (with more seats). We also tried adding more mothers so we had 10 in total, and with this we were still able to find a schedule - albeit a somewhat longer one: with the same times as in \texttt{Task 2} (\Cref{sec:task2}) it takes at least 103 units.

We found that having, for example, 2 mothers allowed us to have as many girls as we wanted, as it would make it possible to simply put a mother on each side, effectively removing the restraint that fathers are not allowed to be alone with girls.

Finally, we found that increasing the size of the boat to 3 also allowed us to move infinitely many passengers: the police officer moves the thieves over, and then a father and mother move the rest of the passengers together.
